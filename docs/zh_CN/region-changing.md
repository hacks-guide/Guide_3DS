# 区域变更

## Required Reading

This is an add-on section for region changing your console. 这是通过安装你想要切换到的地区的 11.15.0 CTRTransfer 镜像而达成的。 After installing the image, you can update your console normally to the latest firmware (11.17.0).

注意，Luma3DS 本身就自带了[区域模拟](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/wiki/Optional-features)的功能，这使得变更区域几乎是不必要的。 顺带一提，你可以使用 [TWiLight Menu++](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases) 来运行其他区域的 NDS 游戏。 You should only perform a region change if you wish to have your system UI is in a language that is not available on your console's current region.

::: info

This page assumes that you have already installed Luma3DS and boot9strap. If you followed this website to the end (Finalizing Setup), you have Luma3DS and boot9strap.

::: warning

As a part of this process, your system settings will be reset to its defaults. This includes things such as your username, country, and language. **Installed games and their save data will not be affected.**

::: danger

If you change the region of your console:

- You will not be able to use your NNID (if you have one). NNID 在创建时即被锁定在它的创建区域。
- You may not be able to access the eShop, even if you [delete your eShop account](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/74/~/how-to-delete-a-nintendo-eshop-account) beforehand. 这是因为 3DS 中的某些应用会在进入时绑定使用区域（特别是 New 3DS 上）。
    - This is still relevant because, while purchases can no longer be made on eShop, game updates are still being provided. Updates may provide extra content or fix bugs.
    - This logic extends to system transfers, meaning you would not be able to perform a system transfer from a USA 3DS to a region-changed JPN-to-USA 3DS.
    - Pokémon Bank also requires working eShop access.
    - That being said, system transfer and game updates are region locked anyway (e.g. Japanese eShop only has Japanese game updates).
- **You will not be able to uninstall custom firmware without bricking the console!** If you intend to uninstall custom firmware in the future, you **MUST** restore your NAND backup that was created before the region change.
