## Issues with Soundhax

:::details Red/purple/pink and white screen after running Soundhax

If your console is on system version 9.4.0, 9.5.0, or 9.6.0, you may be encountering a bug with an old version of universal-otherapp. Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest).

If your console is not on those firmwares, it likely indicates that you already have custom firmware. 你应该[检查一下](checking-for-cfw)。

:::

:::details "An error has occurred, forcing the software to close..." (white message box)

你放的 `otherapp.bin` 文件有问题（丢失、放错位置或者损坏）。 下载最新版本的 [universal-otherapp](https://github.com/TuxSH/universal-otherapp/releases/latest) 并将其放在你 SD 卡的根目录中。

If the above doesn't fix your issue, and you are using an Old 3DS / Old 3DS XL / Old 2DS, you may be encountering an issue involving cartridge updates. Take another look at the system version. If the last number is 4 or lower (e.g. 11.3.0-**4**U), replace the Soundhax file on the root of your SD card with the one from [here](http://soundhax.686178.xyz/frankenfirm.html?crash).

If none of these fix your issue, join [Nintendo Homebrew on Discord](https://discord.gg/MWxPgEp) for assistance.

:::details "Could not play"

You have the wrong Soundhax file for your console, region and version. Double-check that you entered all the info correctly into the [Soundhax website](https://soundhax.com/), redownload your Soundhax file, and replace it with the one on the root of your SD card.

If the above doesn't fix your issue, and you are using an Old 3DS / Old 3DS XL / Old 2DS, you may be encountering an issue involving cartridge updates. Take another look at the system version. If the last number is 3 or lower (e.g. 11.3.0-**0**U), replace the Soundhax file on the root of your SD card with the one from [here](http://soundhax.686178.xyz/frankenfirm.html?unplayable).
