# Installing boot9strap (super-skaterhax)

::: details Technical Details (optional)

For technical details on the exploits that you will be using on this page, see [here](https://github.com/zoogie/super-skaterhax).

:::

### Compatibility Notes

Super-skaterhax (when used to launch the Homebrew Launcher) is compatible with New models on version 11.15.0 and above in all regions.

::: info

This exploit is known to be inconsistent: it works for some people, but not others. If you prefer to use a more consistent exploit (which may take longer, but will have the same end result), follow [MSET9](installing-boot9strap-(mset9)) instead.

:::

### What You Need

* The [Super-skaterhax](https://skater.nintendohomebrew.com) `.zip` for your console's region and system version

#### Section I - Prep Work

In this section, you will copy the files needed to trigger both super-skaterhax and the Homebrew Launcher.

1. Power off your console
1. Insert your SD card into your computer
1. Copy everything from the Super-skaterhax `.zip` to the root of your SD card. If any of the files exist, overwrite them with the new files.

1. Tap on the address bar at the top of the bottom screen
1. Enter the URL corresponding to your console's region:
    + **USA/EUR/JPN**: `https://skater.686178.xyz/go/super`
    + **KOR**: `https://skater.686178.xyz/go/korea`

1. Wait for the page to fully load, then press (A) to dismiss the [popup](/images/screenshots/skaterhax/skater-popup.png)
1. If your console displays:
    + **"The Homebrew Launcher" screen**: Continue to the next step
    + **A white "Error has occurred" message box**: The exploit failed due to random chance. Open System Settings, change the language to a different one (if possible), then retry this section. You may have to repeat this sequence up to ten times
        + On JPN/KOR region consoles, there is only one language setting. On those consoles, you should open System Settings, close it, then retry this section
        + If the exploit is still unsuccessful after five attempts, there may be a problem with your files or prep work. Ensure that region and date/time are correct, and that you have been following this section **exactly**. If you used WinRAR to extract files to the SD card, re-extract the files using File Explorer or 7-zip instead
        + If the exploit is still unsuccessful after ten attempts, follow [MSET9](installing-boot9strap-(mset9)) instead
    + **A black screen that says "An error has occurred"**: Your file placement is incorrect. Ensure that the super-skaterhax files are on the root of the SD card
    + **A yellow screen**: Homebrew Launcher failed to open due to random chance. Hold the POWER button until the console turns off, then retry this section
    + **[The word "Text"](/images/screenshots/skaterhax/skater-old3ds.png)**: You have an Old 3DS, where this exploit **does not work**. If this is the case, you should follow [MSET9](installing-boot9strap-(mset9)) instead
1. Launch nimdsphax from the list of homebrew
1. If the exploit was successful, you will have booted into SafeB9SInstaller
    + If your console freezes on a red or green screen, hold the POWER button until it turns off, then retry this section

#### Section III - Installing boot9strap

    + If the top screen is blank **and** you see "Crypto Status - all checks passed" on the bottom screen, you will have to enter the key combo blindly. Press the following buttons on your console in this order:
        + D-Pad Left, D-Pad Down, D-Pad Right, D-Pad Up, A
