# Region Changing

## Lecture Requise

This is an add-on section for region changing your console. This is done by installing the 11.15.0 CTRTransfer image for the region you want to switch to. After installing the image, you can update your console normally to the latest firmware (11.17.0).

Note that region changing is almost completely unnecessary since Luma3DS supports out-of-region games and individual title [Locale Emulation](https://github.com/LumaTeam/Luma3DS/wiki/Optional-features). Additionally, running NDS games with alternative out-of-region languages is supported by [TWiLight Menu++](https://github.com/DS-Homebrew/TWiLightMenu/releases). You should only perform a region change if you wish to have your system UI in a language that is not available on your console's current region.

::: info

This page assumes that you have already installed Luma3DS and boot9strap. If you followed this website to the end (Finalizing Setup), you have Luma3DS and boot9strap.

::: warning

As a part of this process, your system settings will be reset to its defaults. This includes things such as your username, country, and language. **Installed games and their save data will not be affected.**

::: danger

If you change the region of your console:

- You will not be able to use your NNID (if you have one). NNIDs are locked to the region that they were created in.
- You may not be able to access the eShop, even if you [delete your eShop account](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/74/~/how-to-delete-a-nintendo-eshop-account) beforehand. This is because certain titles tend to remain linked to the 3DS, even after account deletion (especially on New 3DS).
    - This is still relevant because, while purchases can no longer be made on eShop, game updates are still being provided. Updates may provide extra content or fix bugs.
    - This logic extends to system transfers, meaning you would not be able to perform a system transfer from a USA 3DS to a region-changed JPN-to-USA 3DS.
    - Pokémon Bank also requires working eShop access.
    - That being said, system transfer and game updates are region locked anyway (e.g. Japanese eShop only has Japanese game updates).
- **You will not be able to uninstall custom firmware without bricking the console!** If you intend to uninstall custom firmware in the future, you **MUST** restore your NAND backup that was created before the region change.
