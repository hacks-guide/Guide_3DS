# Already have CFW

## Required Reading

Your console already has custom firmware installed. This may not be obvious, as custom firmware is often invisible in day-to-day usage.

This section will help you determine how to upgrade your custom firmware setup.

::: info

If your console has a menuhax-based CFW setup, you should [clear HOME Menu's extdata](troubleshooting-post-install), then follow all instructions on your SysNAND. You probably have a menuhax-based setup if your system version when booting without an SD card is 9.2.0-20.

## Instructions

1. Power off your console
1. Hold the (Select) button
1. Power on your console while still holding the (Select) button
1. You should now see a configuration menu of some sort
