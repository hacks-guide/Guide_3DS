# Flashing ntrboot (3DS Multi System)

## Lectura requerida

Before proceeding, ensure you have read all of the information on [ntrboot](ntrboot).

This method requires temporary access to a second 3DS family console that is already running boot9strap. This does not require your flashcart to support either 3DS's version.

::: danger

Note that in some rare circumstances, it may be possible for the flashing process to **brick** a counterfeit flashcart and render it permanently unusable. This is unlikely, but nevertheless, only original listed flashcarts are supported. To reduce the chance of receiving a counterfeit card, it is recommended that you use a reputable site to buy your flashcart (such as [NDS Card](https://www.nds-card.com/)).
